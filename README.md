# Rust_Exploration

## Purpose
This is a random repo for the purpose of exploring Rust.  Will this get much traction?  I really can't say.  At the moment, I have a lot other things I probably need to finish.  However, I am really curious.  If I had studied JavaScript when I first became interested in it, some ten plus years ago, I would have been an expert.  Rust gives me the same feeling I had back then.  It's something I really don't want to ignore.  As such, I'll periodically log entries when I get the time.  If this becomes serious, I'll use this repo as my "training ground."
