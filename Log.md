## 2023 02 03 | Start Exploring Rust_Exploration

I started Exploring Rust a couple of days. I am really getting interested int this programming language. Is it for me? I don't know. Should I be adding this as a distraction when I am so busy? Absolutely not. Of course that won't stop me. Wish me luck!

## 2023 02 12 | YT Project

Sometimes I get tired of learning concepts and just want to build. Afterall, you need a wall to post ideas on... that is what a project is form me. It is a place were I can take the many concept building blocks and see them function. Otherwise, I find everything is just scattered around in my brain and I'll never remember how they work. That's why I'm going to take a "breif" moment to run through some YT projects: [Getting started with Rust programming language ðŸ¦€ 2021: 4. Building a CLI app in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km2UijVC3M&t=70s), by creativcoder. Here are the resources we are using:

- [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
- [Crate ureq](https://docs.rs/ureq/latest/ureq/)
- [Serde JSON](https://docs.rs/crate/serde_json/latest)
- [Colour](https://docs.rs/colour/latest/colour/)
- Bacon is also installed in the proj `cargo install bacon` <- This is awsome, as it tells us something is wrong before needing to run the program!
