## 2023 02 03 | Start Exploring Rust_Exploration

I started Exploring Rust a couple of days. I am really getting interested int this programming language. Is it for me? I don't know. Should I be adding this as a distraction when I am so busy? Absolutely not. Of course that won't stop me. Wish me luck!
